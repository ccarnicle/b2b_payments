# Frontend (`next-app` package)

This package contains the Next.js frontend for the **Smart Pacts** project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14+:** React framework (using App Router).
- **Privy:** For authentication and wallet management.
- **Pinata:** For decentralized storage of pact agreements on IPFS.
- **Tailwind CSS v3:** For styling.
- **ethers.js v6:** For smart contract interaction.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety.

## ‚úÖ Current Status: MVP Functionality Complete

The frontend is feature-complete for the MVP. The entire user journey‚Äîfrom creating a pact to distributing funds‚Äîis fully implemented and tested on the Filecoin Calibration testnet.

- **Pact Creation:** A unified form at `/create` allows users to create and fund both **Prize Pool** and **Milestone** pacts, including the secure upload of terms to IPFS.
- **Pact Browsing:** The homepage (`/`) displays all created pacts by fetching on-chain event data.
- **Pact Detailing:** The dynamic detail page (`/vault/[id]`) shows comprehensive on-chain data and the full agreement terms from IPFS.
- **Fund Distribution:** The UI provides conditional actions, allowing funders to release milestone payments or distribute prize pool funds to multiple recipients after the time lock has expired.

## üìà Next Steps: Polish & Multi-Chain Support

The next phase is focused on refining the user experience and expanding the project's reach.

- [ ] **UI/Layout Refactor:** Re-architect the UI into a dashboard layout with a dedicated sidebar for navigation.
- [ ] **Create New App Pages:** Build out pages for `/app/active`, `/app/completed`, and a placeholder for `/app/invoicing`.
- [ ] **Multi-Chain Context:** Implement a network context to manage chain-specific details (RPC URLs, contract addresses).
- [ ] **Flow EVM Integration:** Deploy the contract to the Flow EVM testnet and add it to the network context, enabling a network switcher in the UI.

### üé® Branding & Color Palette
The application uses a modern, clean **light theme**. The color system is built into `globals.css` using CSS variables and is fully integrated with Tailwind CSS.
